doi = {10.1177/0954410013475573}, 
abstract ={In this study, due to the innate trans-atmospheric nature of flight of the space transportation system, assessment of the control discipline interaction with aerodynamic, weights and sizing, external fin-stabilizers configuration, and trajectory disciplines in an multidisciplinary design optimization-based platform has been addressed. Parameters considered for the control sub-system optimization are external stabilizing fins geometrical characteristics and attitude control vernier motors thrust value. Specifically, this article addresses optimization of fin–body combinations with geometric constraints for minimizing control moment required by vernier motors as well as total possible control sub-system weight satisfying design constraints. Results show that using external stabilizer fins is not economical from energetic stand point for space transportation system, but is necessary for control subsystems when there are deflection constraints for vernier motors.},
